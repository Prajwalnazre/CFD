This project was done as a part of a team of 5 including myself under the guidance of our college professors. Computation Fluid Dynamics is the study of fluid flow when encountered with objects. The project it aimed at simulating the same using 2 different techniques i.e using High Performance Computing and using Deep learning techniques

Below is the image of the input given to the model.

The output image is displayed in 3 different columns

1st Column - Raw input 
2nd Column - Result obtained using the traditional Lattice Boltzmann technique
3rd Column - Result obtained using Machine Learning Technique
